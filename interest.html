          <h1>My Interest in IT!</h1>
          <p>My interest for IT dated back when I was really young, where I was amazed that a machine that can do it all! The reason
            why I chose Bachelor of Information Technology is because Technology is such a awsome topic to lean about, the everlasting
            trend of Technology is still growing and will ultimately expand for the years to come!</p>

        <h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>
        <p><br>My interest for IT dated back when floppy disk was still a thing and dvr was a trend to have! It excites me to see my dad
          work on his old box computer and whenever he would turn it on I'll just stare at it as if it was my last time on earth.
          <br><br>My love for Information Technology is indefinite as I see Technology grow it astounds me on so much can be achieve
          in a couple of years. My first ever game I played on my dad's computer was 'PinBall Space Cadet'. If I could say one interest
          for IT would be the hardware and software that makes modern society communicate with each other.</p>

          <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
          <p>The main reason why I chose to come to RMIT is because of the covienence, But I now know that it is so much more than just
            convienance. RMIT is social, convienant, has a broad range of social clubs, social teachers, <i>convienant</i> teachers,
            social people, social building, social elevator, social escalators and most importantly I got a shit atar.<br><br>As how
            great RMIT is, I am yet to learn so much more as I will be transferring(hopefully) to swinburne! Swinburne provides alot
            of resources not saying RMIT doesnt provide resources but provides computer science job experiences.</p>

        <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
        <p><br>At the prestigous university that RMIT can offer, I will expect to learn alot from it. I believe that that anyone can learn
          alot from RMIT aslong they find someone that knows what they are doing and can leech of them and earn that certificate!<br><br>There are alot of learning materials that RMIT can offer such as wikipedia, other unviversity tutorials and RMIT
