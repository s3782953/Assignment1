          <hr>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The project idea will be a social mobile application that is focused on people that is looking for a partner in their area.
            The application is based on a dating application such as Tinder, Bumble and Grindr. This application will be developed mainly
            for mobile devices, for quick and easy use for the user. It will help the user to find a match of a hopeful partner and also
            will be given the ability to its match partner if possible. This application will be mainly for RMIT user that is looking
            for a partner and a friend in a specific course or multiples.</p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>The reason why I want to create this app is that there are so many unfortunate souls that cannot find a partner, due to their
          common reason: ‘Lack of social experience’. It’s a shame because they don’t know where to start nor how to gain social skills,
          my main drive is to create an app that will not only help those who lack the skills of social cues, but will ultimately help
          them find the “one”. It would probably won’t happen straight away but the main goal is to get those who want new experience
          an experience that they probably yearn for.</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Its main target audience is people for all ages that are wanting to find a relationship. The user will have to create a
            unique account for themselves that will consist of the generic username and password. The application will determine what age
            you are, what gender you are, and it will ask the user what age range they would like to date. The app will also determine the
            user’s preference of sex (It can be both). The application will ask a series of questions such as what is your favourite
            hobby (optional), how tall are you (optional), give a brief summary about yourself, favourite food (optional), what course
            in RMIT are you in and what type of people are you looking for (optional). These kinds of questioning will form an
            introduction of the user, to show other users about themselves. The application will allow the user to change gender if
            accidentally chosen wrong in the settings menu, it also will allow users to change age, name and it also allows the user
            to delete the whole account. If they are done using it. The application will let the user add or remove a picture from
            the profile. The user will be able to see many other users that fit with the user's preferences, the user has the
            ability to add them, but cannot message them directly until the other recipient adds them back. When both users add
            each other they both have the ability to contact each other directly, through both text and calls. If the user
            decides that the other users are not a good fit for them, the application allows the user to remove them from their
            friend's list, and won’t be able to contact or add them back again. The app can locate how far the user is between
            possible friends in the recommended list. Depending on what course the user has chosen, the recommended list will
            only see a user that’s chosen that’s doing the preference the user has chosen. In the main page, it will show a
            user picture and profile details if clicked upon. Once the user clicked on ‘more information’ the application
            will then go to the chosen users profile and display all variants of information such as, a brief introduction,
            how far the user lives, what course they are doing, what are their favourite hobbies. The user's profile also
            consists of many pictures, depending on how many photos they decided to upload. The user can click on the
            picture to show the next picture they’ve uploaded above the picture shows an indication on what picture
            you on and also tells how many photos are there until it cycles back to the starting photo. Still, on the
            user's profiles page, the user will still be given the option to request a ‘match’ or to say ‘no’ and
            continue on to the next user. If accidentally pressing no on a user, the application will allow the user
            to ‘roll back’, undo its own action to see the previous user (this can be done an indefinite amount of
            time)</p>

        <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
        <p>The tools and technologies I’ll be using will mainly be MIT app inventor, it is a simple and easy software that is used to create a
          mobile application. In the application they give you a visual appearance of what it will look like on your mobile phone, it is
          simple software as you can click and drag what attributes or object that you want to add on your application. The hardware required
          will be a computer that has internet access and an Android mobile phone that also has internet access. The application allows the
          user to see a live preview on their mobile device by installing a plugin “MIT AI2 Companion”.</p>

          <h3>Skills Required</h3>
          <p>The skills that are required is basic knowledge on how to use the ‘MIT app inventor’ it is necessary to have this skill, as it
            is the tool that creates a mobile application. Having simple basic knowledge of both using a computer and a mobile device as
            it because if the user does not know how to use either device they will have troubling knowing where things are and not
            knowing basic functions. Learning these skills will need time and effort on both devices and software. A tutorial can help
            fasten the process of learning these skills but still requires time and effort.</p>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>If the project is successful, people will be able to finally make friends with others with the same course or different courses.
          They will be able to communicate with this friend at any time of the day. The will be able to establish themselves in the
          community of the application. The outcome should be that a user in RMIT should be able to communicate with other users that
          also looking for friends in this university.</p>
